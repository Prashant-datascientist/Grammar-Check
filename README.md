# Grammar-Check
This is an ML project where I employed Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for Sequence-to-Sequence learning, along with a Sequence-to-Sequence Attention mechanism, using the Tensorflow library. Additionally, NLP techniques were applied to clean the texts. The project consists of multiple files, with each file dedicated to performing different tasks.
